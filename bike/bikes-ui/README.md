##Project done with Pluralsight course "Spring Boot and angular"

using Spring Boot and Angular I tried to implement OAuth provided by Auth0 (but failed). The end result is I am unable to login as it is showing me a "403 forbidden" errror. Apart from that rest of the functioning is working if I go for the 'permitAll()' option on my Spring API configuration
